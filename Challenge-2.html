                        <p>
                            Hello all! My name is Monineath (MOH-ni-neeth). I know, it is a unique name, isn't it? My grandpa named me after the Queen of Cambodia. This was already a rare name back in my home country, but after coming to the U.S. at the age of 8, I realize this name was even more of "one-of-a-kind".

                        <p>
                            My boyfriend and I moved from Minneapolis, MN to the Bay Area in March of 2022 due to his job opportunity as software engineer with LinkedIn. His career milstone allowed us to begin a new chapter in our lives.

                        <h3>Career Changes</h3>
                        <p>
                            I first finished my degree in Dental Assisting in 2015. After working in various dental offices for a few years, I realized that this was not going to be a good long term career for me. Dental assisting has a high rate of burnout and I became a part of that statistics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2018, I moved into a manufacturing line of work in the quality assurance department. Starting off at an entry level position with QA Inspection, then moving up into a QA Technician role 2 yrs later. Once again
