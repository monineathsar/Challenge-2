                    <p>
                        Hello all! My name is Monineath (MOH-ni-neeth). I know, it is a unique name, isn't it? My grandpa named me after the Queen of Cambodia. This was already a rare name back in my home country, but after coming to the U.S. at the age of 8, I realize this name was even more of "one-of-a-kind".

                        Having grown up in Minnesota majority of my life, I've learned to pick up hobbies to rotate for winter and summer days. I've dabbled in indoor rock climbing, wheel throwing, sewing, weight lifting, rollerblading & skating, longboarding,and attending music festivals & concerts. 
                    </p>

                        My boyfriend and I moved to the Bay Area in March of 2022 due to him accepting a software engineer position with LinkedIn. His career milstone gave us both an opportunity for a new chapter in our lives. Now that I'm in NorCal, I'm really looking forward to picking up more hobbies, possibly hiking. Is there any specific hobbies that people in Sillicone Valley like to do for fun?

                    <h3>Career Changes</h3>
                    <p>
                         From a healthcare degree in 2015, then moved into manufacturing a few years later, only to have another itch for a career change in 2022; one might think I've been a little ADHD with my career paths.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I first finished my degree in Dental Assisting in 2015. After working in various dental offices for a few years, I realized that this was not going to be a good long term career for me. Dental assisting requires high physical and mental demand with high rates of burnout. We are the jack of all trades in the dental office.
