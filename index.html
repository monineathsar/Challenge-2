                        <p>
                            Hello all! My name is Monineath (MOH-ni-neeth). I know, it is a unique name, isn't it? My grandpa named me after the Queen of Cambodia. This was already a rare name back in my home country, but after coming to the U.S. at the age of 8, I realize this name was even more of "one-of-a-kind". 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've lived in Minnesota ever since coming to the U.S. You would think that I would've tolerated the winters pretty well after spending most of my life with Minnesota cold temps (winter of 2020, temps reached as cold as -30Â°F!). But nope, once my boyfriend was given a job opportunity in the Bay Area, we couldn't turn down the chance to live somewhere warm. What's funny though, now that we are here in California, that I've complained to my boyfriend almost everyday that it's chilly here while completely forgetting that I used to put up with snow in April in Minnesota.

                        <h3>Career Changes</h3>
                        <p>
                            I first finished my Associates degree in Dental Assisting in 2015. After working in various dental offices for a few years, I realized that this was not going to be a good long term career for me. It is a very fast paced field that requires you to be on your toes all day. Such a high mental and physical demand can be exhausting when you have to maintain that level of focus 40hrs a week. Dental assisting has a high rate of burnout and I became a part of that statistics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2018, I moved into a manufacturing line of work in the quality assurance department. Starting off at an entry level position with QA Inspection, then moving up into a QA Technician role 2 yrs later within the same company. Once again I was faced with a decision of whether or not I want to pursue further into the field. Although I was very passionate about my job and always exceeded management's expectations, I was hesitant of this career path because as a QA Tech, the scope of my responsibilities are of things that are out of my control, which lead to burnout as well.

                        <p>
                            However, things worked out in my favor once my boyfriend accepted his job in San Jose, I was ready for a new start. I decided to take this as a sign to start a new chapter in my professional life.

                    <section id="why">
                        <h3>Why coding?</h3>
                        <p>
                            As I've mentioned before, my boyfriend accepted a job here in the Bay Area. Did I mention what the job he accepted? He's now a Software Engineer for LinkedIn! Pretty cool right? I saw him spending months doing self studies and preparing for interviews. It is a huge milestone for him to get this job offer, at least to me. What's even cooler was the total compensation package he was offered. Not going to lie; this was the biggest motivation for me to start coding too!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Though money is not the only motivator for me. I also have other friends who also does coding and they have always advocated for a career in the tech industry every time I vented to them about my work. I've considered this career path in the past but there was just obstacles in my way, felt the timing was not right, and I couldn't keep up with self study due to working full-time. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since my boyfriend has accepted his role at LinkedIn, I was fially given the opportunity to do a coding bootcamp. Since he now has amazing compensation, it has allowed me to focus soley on school while working part-time.
